This team project has three manditory tasks and a couples as advance tasks.
I am Mariam teaming up with my peer Yara to create our printf function.

these are some general rules at the beginning we need to follow, such as:
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- No more than 5 functions per file

Also there are limited functions to use:
write (man 2 write)
malloc (man 3 malloc)
free (man 3 free)
va_start (man 3 va_start)
va_end (man 3 va_end)
va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 Task number 0 - Printf
_________________________________________________________________________________
We need to build a function following the rules mentioned above. this function should
be able to print all these specifers (c s %).
using Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
printing (c) which is a single character
printing (s) which is a string
printing (%) which is a percentage sign
creating 4 files:
_printf.c - For Script
main.h - Header files and  prototypes
print_string.c - Prints a string
functions.c -
