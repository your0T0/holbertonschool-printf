\" ===================== FILE OVERVIEW =====================
\" File: man_3_printf
\" Purpose:
\"     This file provides the manual (man page) documentation for
\"     the custom _printf function implemented in this project.
\"
\" What is a man page?
\"     • A man page is an official Unix/Linux manual page.
\"     • It explains what a function/command does, how to use it,
\"       what parameters it takes, what it returns, and any
\"       limitations it has.
\"
\" Why do we need this file?
\"     • To document how _printf works for users and reviewers.
\"     • To follow the same style as the real printf documentation
\"       found in section 3 of the system manuals (man 3 printf).
\"     • The project requirements explicitly ask for a man page.
\"
\" What does this file contain?
\"     • NAME:       Short description of the function.
\"     • SYNOPSIS:   Header file + function prototype.
\"     • DESCRIPTION: How the function behaves and what formats it handles.
\"     • RETURN VALUE: Success/error behavior.
\"     • LIMITATIONS: Restrictions of this implementation.
\"     • SEE ALSO:    Related references like printf(3).
\"
\" Notes:
\"     • This file uses groff formatting syntax (the standard for man pages).
\"     • It documents support for the required format specifiers:
\"       %c, %s, %%, %d, %i

.TH _PRINTF 3 "November 2025" "1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
_printf \- custom implementation of the printf function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function produces output according to a format string.
It writes its output to the standard output stream (stdout)
using the write system call and handles a variable number of arguments.

The
.I format
string is composed of ordinary characters, which are written unchanged,
and directives beginning with the percent sign (%).

A directive consists of '%' followed by a conversion specifier.

The following conversion specifiers are handled:

.TP
.B %c
Prints a single character.

.TP
.B %s
Prints a null-terminated string.

.TP
.B %%
Prints a literal percent sign.

.TP
.B %d , %i
Prints a signed decimal integer.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
.B _printf()
returns the number of characters printed,
excluding the terminating null byte.

If an error occurs (such as a NULL format string),
the function returns -1.

.SH LIMITATIONS
This version of
.B _printf()
does not handle flags, field width, precision, length modifiers,
or buffer management used in the standard C library printf.
