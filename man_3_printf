.SH NAME
_printf \- custom implementation of the printf function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The

function produces output according to a format.
It writes its output to the standard output stream (stdout)
using the write system call.

The
.I format
string is composed of zero or more directives.
Ordinary characters in the format string are written to the output
unchanged.

A directive starts with the percent sign (%) and is followed by a
conversion specifier.

The following conversion specifiers are handled:

.TP
.B %c
Prints a single character.

.TP
.B %s
Prints a null-terminated string.

.TP
.B %%
Prints a literal percent sign.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
.B _printf()
returns the number of characters printed,
excluding the terminating null byte.

If an error occurs, the function returns -1.

.SH LIMITATIONS
This version of
.B _printf()
does not handle flags, field width, precision, length modifiers,
or buffer management used in the standard C library printf.
